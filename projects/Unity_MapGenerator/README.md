# Unity Map Generator
Very basic map generator used to practice with programmatically object spawning.
It comes with an editor script (MapEditor.cs) that allows you to see all the changes (variable changes through MapGenerator.cs object inspector) applied instantly to the scene.

This repo contains a ready to use Unity project to demonstrate how to use the map generator.
